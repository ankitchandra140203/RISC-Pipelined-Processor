# RISC Pipelined Processor
 RISC Pipelined Processor implemented in verilog
1> Developed a five-stage pipelined RISC processor in Verilog, featuring a 32x32 register bank and 1024x32 memory.
2> The processor supports basic operations including load/store from memory, addition, and other arithmetic/logic operations.
3> Implemented functionality to compute the factorial of a number and store the result in memory.
